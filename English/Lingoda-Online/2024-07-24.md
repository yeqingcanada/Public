## homework

I want to state my opinions on why I need it and what changes it will bring.

First of all, given that we don't have a library in the city center, the new library is very necessary. As a result of the new library, the residents will have some place to get quite and read books.

I know that many residents oppose this proposal due to the budget, however, considering the benefits of the new building, I strongly support this proposal.
