# Conflict management

- Focus on the problem
  - I think this would be a better way to go.
  - Let’s try to solve this together
  - Unfortunately, that fails to solve the problem.
  - Let’s focus on the main issue at hand.
- Find common ground
  - Perhaps we can find a compromise.
  - How about we incorporate both of our ideas?
  - I appreciate your support and input.
  - There might be a third position that we are ignoring.
- Calming the situation down
  - Please do not raise your voice.
  - Would you mind sitting down?
  - Let’s not let this escalate.
  - There is no reason for us to argue over this.
- Saying no
  - We do not condone those methods here.
  - We do not want to escalate the situation further.
  - Please do not endorse using such methods.
  - I’m afraid that is unacceptable
- 劝说
  - I’m afraid…
  - It’s intolerable…
  - Unfortunately…
  - Surely we can…
